DataTransferObjects (DTOs) are objects used to encapsulate and transfer data between different layers or components of an application. They are typically 
used to carry data from one part of the system (e.g., the database or service 
layer) to another (e.g., the presentation or API layer) without exposing the 
internal implementation details or domain logic. 

DTOs help in maintaining separation of concerns, improving code readability, and ensuring that only the required data is shared between layers.
